### Why ?

This is a learning project. The goal was to develop a real time kanban board without using the available drag and drop libraries.

### Tech Stack

The app is composed of a **React** frontend styled with **Styled Components** and unit tested with **Jest** & **Enzyme**.
The drag and drop events are native **html 5**.
The real time events are managed through **socket.io** on a small **express** nodejs server.
